BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

1. we used all the env.config properties in our code and supported it
2. almost every class
3. we changed the properties and checked that the configuartion has changed in game


--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

1. we made enum GameMode which has 3 game modes (countdown , countup , nocount) 
2. the game mode was set in the dealer consturctor and the changes was on update time method and the dealer inner loop method
3. we changed the configuration property - TurnTimeoutSeconds to -1, 0 and any other number to check that every game mode is supported


--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

1. we made sure we dont use other threads but the ones that stated above.
2. dealer class, player class.
3. we printed to console the sleeps and wake ups of different threads and checked that they sleep and wake up on time.
